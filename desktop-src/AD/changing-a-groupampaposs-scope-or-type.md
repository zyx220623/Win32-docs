# Changing a Group's Scope or Type

Changing a group scope or type is not allowed in mixed-mode domains. However, the following conversions are allowed in native-mode domains:

Domain local group to universal group: The domain local group being converted cannot contain another domain local group or members from another forest, that exist in the domain as Foreign Security Principals (FSP).

Global group to universal group: This is only allowed if the global group is not a member of another global group.

Universal group to global or domain local group: For conversion to global group, the universal group being converted cannot contain users or global groups from another domain. For conversion to domain local group, the universal group being converted cannot be a member of any universal group or a domain local group from another domain.

You can only change from global group to domain local group and vice versa through a universal group. These are separate steps, so each time the restrictions above apply.

**Note**: When a global or universal group is converted to a domain local group, the Sid of this group is only in access tokens on members of the group where the domain exists. If this Sid was used in Access Control Lists on machines in other domains, the user would get access permitted only as if it was not member of the group.

In native mode, a group type can be converted freely between security groups and distribution groups.

Be aware that if a group is used to set access control, changing the scope or type can affect the access control entries (ACEs) that contain that group. The security system will ignore ACEs that contain groups that are not security groups.
